Describe the two dependent variables (outcomes) for experiment 1 and experiment 2 
    - Describe for each experiment: 
        - What was the best performing model (please interpret (a) log-loss or RMSE between models, and (b) AUC) 
        - How much better (? if any) did the model perform compared to baseline


In experiment one we work with the Type of Admission variable. 

The best performing model for experiment 1 was Xgboost log-loss 0.221934
compared to baseline 1.04705 (79% improvement).

In experiment two we work with the variable AGE.

The best performing model for experiment 2 was Ensemble rmse 12.704 
compared to baseline 30.0267 (68% improvement).
